"""
Computes DISTANCE AND PATH from startNode to the every other node in graph using Dijkstras Algorithm.

Arguments: G - reference to networkx graph, startNode - node from which search starts
Return: visited - dictionary of all nodes and their distance from startNode 
        path - dictionary of visited nodes and path to the from startNode
        
Time complexity: Depends on the implementation (data structure used)
                        - With Adjacency List and Priority Queue: O((v + e) log v)
                        - With matrix and Priority Queue: O(v^2 + e log v)
                        - With Fibonacci Heap and Adjacency List: O(e + v log v)

Note: G must be
        - weighted (weights must be positive)
      If G has more components
        - unreachable components won't appear in path dictionary
        - values of unreachable components in visited dictionary is infinity

"""
Dijkstra's algorithm works similarly as Prim's algorithms for minimum spanning tree.
If we want to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path from A to B, we can stop when B is in visited.
If we want to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find minimum spanning tree, we have to let it find shortest path to all nodes.
The only difference is that in Prim's, we can choose our source node - when using Dijkstra's, it is given.
