"""
Computes DISTANCE AND PATH from startNode to the every other node in graph using Dijkstras Algorithm.

Arguments: G - reference to networkx graph, startNode - node from which search starts
Return: visited - dictionary of all nodes and their distance from startNode 
        path - dictionary of visited nodes and path to the from startNode

Note: G must be
        - weighted (weights must be positive)
        - weights of edges can't be large number (using 1000 instead of infinity)
      If G has more components
        - unreachable components won't appear in path dictionary
        - values of unreachable components in visited dictionary is 1000 (my infinity)
