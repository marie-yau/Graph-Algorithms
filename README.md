# Graphs Algorithm

This project implements various graph algorithms in Python from scratch and and visualizes their results using `networkx` library.

## Shortest Path Algorithms
A shortest path is a path between two nodes that has the minimum possible total edge weight.

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Breadth Search First Algorithm

## Graph Coloring
To solve a graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color and we use the minimum number of colors possible. 

This can be done by:

- Greedy Algorithm
- DSatur Algorithm

## Minimum Spanning Tree
A minimum spanning tree of a graph is a set of the edges that connects all the vertices together without creating any cycles and has the minimum possible total edge weight.

This can be done by:
- Kruskal's Algorithm

# Complement
To find the complement of a graph, we need to find another graph on the same vertices such that its two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in the original graph.
