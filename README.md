# Graphs Algorithm
## Shortest Path Algorithms
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - graph can't have edges with negative weights
  - O((v + e) log v): implementation with adjacency list and priority queue
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - graph can have edges with negative weights
  - O(v * e)
- Breadth Search First Algorithm
  - O(v + e): implementation with adjacency list
## Graph Coloring
- Greedy Algorithm
- DSatur Algorithm
## Minimum Spanning Tree
- Kruskal's Algorithm
  - O(e * log e)
